  - Security requirements validated
  - Performance requirements validated
  - Integration requirements validated

- **T110** ✅ Tool registration
  - Verified all 3 tools registered: create_payment_requirement, verify_payment, settle_payment
  - MCP discovery tests pass
  - Tools discoverable via MCP protocol

- **T111** ✅ Extensibility testing
  - Added Polygon network to `config.yaml.example`
  - Created `config-test-polygon.yaml`
  - Created `test_polygon_extensibility.go`
  - Documented in `EXTENSIBILITY_TEST.md`
  - Confirmed: No code changes needed to add new networks
