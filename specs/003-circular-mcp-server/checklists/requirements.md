# Specification Quality Checklist: Circular Protocol MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality - PASS
- Spec is written in user-centric language focusing on "what" agents need to do (certify data, monitor status, retrieve proof)
- No mention of specific Go libraries, mcp-go implementation details, or code structure
- Focused on blockchain certification value for AI agents
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "MUST return current nonce", "MUST calculate transaction IDs as SHA-256")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (60 seconds, 100%, 95%, 5 attempts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of Go, HTTP libraries, specific frameworks)
- 15 acceptance scenarios defined across 4 user stories
- 7 edge cases identified covering API failures, timeouts, invalid inputs
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions sections are comprehensive

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each of the 15 functional requirements maps to user story acceptance scenarios
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover complete certification workflow
- Measurable outcomes defined: 60 second certification time, 100% success rate, graceful error handling
- No implementation leakage - spec describes behavior, not "how to implement"

## Overall Assessment: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
