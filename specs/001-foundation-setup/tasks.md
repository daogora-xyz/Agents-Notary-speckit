# Tasks: Project Foundation Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-foundation-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Per constitution Principle II (Test-First Development), this milestone includes comprehensive test tasks. Tests are written BEFORE implementation code.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Go monorepo**: Root level contains `pkg/`, `migrations/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`
- **Shared packages**: `pkg/models/`, `pkg/crypto/`, `pkg/errors/`
- **Migrations**: `migrations/001_init.up.sql`, `migrations/001_init.down.sql`
- **Tests**: `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/` (unit tests colocated with packages)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/setup-dev.sh`, `scripts/migrate.sh`, `scripts/health-check.sh`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Initialize Go module with `go mod init` at repository root
- [ ] T002 Create directory structure: `pkg/`, `migrations/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 service definitions
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `.env.example` template with all required environment variables
- [ ] T005 [P] Create `Makefile` with common commands (up, down, migrate-up, migrate-down, test, health)
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `.gitignore` with Go, Docker, and IDE-specific entries

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Add Go dependencies to `go.mod`: pgx, go-redis, btcsuite/btcd, testify, dockertest, golang-migrate
- [ ] T008 Run `go mod download` and `go mod tidy` to fetch all dependencies
- [ ] T009 Create database migration files: `migrations/001_init.up.sql` and `migrations/001_init.down.sql` with all 4 table schemas
- [ ] T010 Configure Docker Compose health checks for PostgreSQL (port ready) and Redis (ping response)
- [ ] T011 Create `scripts/migrate.sh` wrapper script for golang-migrate CLI
- [ ] T012 Document PostgreSQL connection string format in `.env.example`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Development Environment Setup (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Developers can initialize complete local development environment with single command

**Independent Test**: Run setup script from fresh checkout, verify all services running, migrations applied, health checks pass

### Tests for User Story 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T020 [US1] Document troubleshooting steps in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common Docker/migration issues

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Data Persistence Layer (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Reliable versioned database schema with 4 tables for certification workflow persistence

- [ ] T032 [US2] Test migration rollback: apply migration, insert data, rollback, verify tables dropped and data gone
- [ ] T033 [US2] Document migration failure recovery procedure in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 should work independently - database schema fully migrated and tested

---

## Phase 5: User Story 4 - Shared Code Utilities (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Reusable Go packages for models, crypto utilities, and error types

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - May use US4 models for testing
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - May cache US4 models
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, no cross-story dependencies
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, provides models for US2/US3
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US4 models for CRUD tests
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May cache US4 models for serialization tests

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Database schema before CRUD operations
- Error handling after core implementation
- Integration tests after unit tests
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: All tasks T003-T006 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Foundational Phase**: T007-T008 sequential, T010 can run in parallel with T009
- **User Story 1 Tests**: T013-T015 all parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 2 Tests**: T021-T025 all parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 4 Tests**: T034-T040 all parallel (different test files)
- **User Story 4 Implementation**: T041-T047 all parallel (different packages/files)
- **User Story 3 Tests**: T050-T053 all parallel (different test files)
- **Polish Phase**: T063-T066, T072 all parallel (different docs/test suites)
- **Cross-Story**: After Foundational phase completes, US1, US2, US3, US4 can all start in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Environment Setup)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Run `scripts/setup-dev.sh` from clean checkout
   - Verify `scripts/health-check.sh` passes
   - Verify Docker Compose services running
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Document (MVP: developers can set up environment)
3. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Document (shared packages available)
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Document (database schema ready for use)
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Document (caching layer available)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Environment Setup)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Shared Packages)
   - Developer C: User Story 2 (Database Schema)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (Caching)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. All stories meet at Polish phase for final integration testing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD: RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Constitution Compliance**: This task list enforces 80% test coverage minimum per Principle II
- **Migration Failure**: Per clarification, failed migrations block startup (T031 validates this behavior)
- **Cache Degradation**: Per clarification, Redis unavailability doesn't block startup (T060 validates this behavior)
- **Redis Eviction**: Per clarification, allkeys-lru policy configured (T054 implements, T053 validates)
