# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Foundation Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

The specification successfully avoids implementation details and focuses on what the system must do, not how. User scenarios are written from a developer/operator perspective (the actual users of infrastructure).

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tools, only capabilities)
- 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- 5 edge cases identified
- Assumptions section documents all defaults

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.

## Notes

This is an infrastructure feature, so the "users" are developers and operators rather than end customers. The specification correctly frames scenarios from their perspective (development environment setup, data persistence needs, etc.).

All checklist items pass. No further clarifications or updates needed.
