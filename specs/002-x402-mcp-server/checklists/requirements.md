## Validation Results

### Content Quality - NEEDS REVIEW ⚠️

**PASS**: Specification focuses on what the system must do (generate payment requirements, verify signatures, settle payments).

**CONCERN**: The specification mentions specific technologies in several places:
- FR-001: "MUST implement MCP server using mcp-go library" - mentions specific library
- Dependencies section lists specific Go packages (github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go, etc.)
- Success criteria reference specific tools (MetaMask, mobile wallets by name)

**MITIGATION**: For an MCP server specification, some technology references are acceptable because:
1. MCP protocol itself is the requirement (technology-agnostic alternatives don't exist for this use case)
2. mcp-go is the official Go implementation of MCP protocol
3. Wallet names (MetaMask, Rainbow) describe the ecosystem compatibility requirements, not implementation
4. Library dependencies are in "Dependencies" section (optional), not core requirements

**VERDICT**: Acceptable as-is, given the nature of the feature.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **20 functional requirements** (FR-001 through FR-020) are testable and specific
- **10 success criteria** with measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-010)
- **5 quality metrics** (QM-001 through QM-005)
- **5 user stories** with priorities (P1, P2, P3) and independent test descriptions
- **23 acceptance scenarios** across all user stories
- **7 edge cases** with specific handling requirements
- **7 open questions** appropriately marked for future clarification
- Out of scope section clarifies boundaries

### Success Criteria Technology-Agnostic Check - PARTIAL PASS ⚠️

Most success criteria are appropriately specified:
- ✅ SC-001: Response time (<100ms) - technology-agnostic performance metric
- ✅ SC-002: Verification accuracy (100%, 1000 test cases) - measurable outcome
- ✅ SC-003: Settlement success rate (95%) - measurable outcome
- ✅ SC-004: x402 schema conformance (100%) - protocol compliance
- ⚠️ SC-005: References "MetaMask" by name - acceptable because it's ecosystem compatibility
- ⚠️ SC-006: References specific wallets - acceptable for same reason
- ✅ SC-007: Concurrency handling (10 simultaneous calls, no race conditions)
- ✅ SC-008: Code coverage (90%+)
- ✅ SC-009: Idempotency performance (<10ms)
- ✅ SC-010: Configuration extensibility

**VERDICT**: Acceptable - wallet names describe ecosystem requirements, not implementation choices.

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

The specification is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.plan`:

**Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization (P1 stories are core payment primitives, P2 are UX enhancements, P3 is mobile workflow)
2. Each user story independently testable with specific test scenarios
3. Functional requirements map directly to user stories
4. Edge cases cover failure scenarios comprehensively
5. Open Questions section acknowledges unknowns (x402 facilitator API spec, EIP-712 domain details)
6. Dependencies clearly separate external services, libraries, and internal components

**Coverage Analysis**:
- User Story 1 (Payment Requirements): Covered by FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006
- User Story 2 (Signature Verification): Covered by FR-007, FR-008, FR-009, FR-010
- User Story 3 (Settlement): Covered by FR-011, FR-012, FR-013, FR-014
- User Story 4 (Browser Links): Covered by FR-015, FR-016
- User Story 5 (QR Encoding): Covered by FR-017, FR-018

All stories have corresponding requirements. ✅

## Notes

### Specification Type
This is an **MCP server component specification** - a developer-facing infrastructure service. The "users" are:
1. The certify.ar4s.com HTTP proxy (programmatic consumer)
2. AI agents (via the proxy)
3. Browser/mobile users (indirectly via generated links/QR codes)

### Technology Constraints
Unlike application features that could use various technologies, MCP servers have inherent constraints:
- Must implement MCP protocol (by definition)
- Must use an MCP server framework (mcp-go is the official Go implementation)
- Must integrate with specific blockchain protocols (EIP-3009, EIP-712, EIP-681)
- Must work with specific payment protocol (x402)

These are **domain requirements**, not arbitrary implementation choices.

### Open Questions Impact
The 7 open questions (Q1-Q7) are appropriately scoped for later clarification:
- Q1 (x402 facilitator API): Affects FR-011 implementation but not the requirement itself
- Q2 (nonce generation): Implementation detail within FR-005 requirement
- Q3 (additional testnets): Scope expansion question
- Q4 (EIP-712 domain): Implementation detail within FR-008
- Q5 (facilitator URL config): Configuration design detail
- Q6 (facilitator versioning): Operational concern
- Q7 (EIP-681 parameter ordering): Implementation detail within FR-017

**None block proceeding to planning phase**. All can be researched/decided during implementation.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. ✅ Proceed with `/speckit.plan` - specification is sufficient for planning
2. During planning, research answers to open questions (especially Q1, Q4)
3. Create research.md document for technical investigation (x402 facilitator API, EIP-712 domain parameters)

## Final Verdict: READY FOR PLANNING ✅

All checklist items pass or have acceptable mitigations. The specification is complete, testable, and provides sufficient detail for implementation planning without over-specifying implementation details.
